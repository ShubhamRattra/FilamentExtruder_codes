# FilamentExtruder_codes

This repo has 3 different codes, each with its own function.

In these codes I have used stepper motor and an easy driver.Limit swich is used in stepper_with_limitswitch code.

The roller_code is the code for stepper to run at a particular speed which is defined in the code till the stepper has power.
The stepper_changespeed is the code to run at 3 speeds each for particular number of loops and both the speed and number of loops at which stepper will run for that speed is defined in the code.
The stepper_with_limitswitch is code to in which the stepper move in a particular direction till it touches a limit switch and it then turns anti-clockwise for particular number of steps which can be defined n the code.
